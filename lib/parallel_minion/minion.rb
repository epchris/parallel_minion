    #     Default: 0 ( Wait forever )
    #
    #     Notes:
    #     - :timeout does not affect what happens to the Minion running the
    #       the task, it only affects how long #result will take to return.
    #     - The Minion will continue to run even after the timeout has been exceeded
    #     - If :enabled is false, or ParallelMinion::Minion.enabled is false,
    #       then :timeout is ignored and assumed to be Minion::INFINITE
    #       since the code is run in the calling thread when the Minion is created

    #   :enabled [Boolean]
    #     Whether the minion should run in a separate thread
    #     Not recommended in Production, but is useful for debugging purposes
    #     Default: ParallelMinion::Minion.enabled?
    #
    #   :on_timeout [Exception]
    #     The class to raise on the minion when the minion times out.
    #     By raising the exception on the running thread it ensures that the thread
    #     ends due to the exception, rather than continuing to execute.
    #     The exception is only raised on the running minion when #result is called.
    #     The current call to #result will complete with a result of nil, future
    #     calls to #result will raise the supplied exception on the current thread
    #     since the thread will have terminated with that exception.
    #
    #     Note: :on_timeout has no effect if not #enabled?
    #
    #   *args
    #     Any number of arguments can be supplied that are passed into the block
    #     in the order they are listed
    #     It is recommended to duplicate and/or freeze objects passed as arguments
    #     so that they are not modified at the same time by multiple threads
    #     These arguments are accessible while and after the minion is running
    #     by calling #arguments
    #
    #   Proc / lambda
    #     A block of code must be supplied that the Minion will execute
    #     NOTE: This block will be executed within the scope of the created minion
    #           instance and _not_ within the scope of where the Proc/lambda was
    #           originally created.
    #           This is done to force all parameters to be passed in explicitly
    #           and should be read-only or duplicates of the original data
    #
    # The overhead for moving the task to a Minion (separate thread) vs running it
    # sequentially is about 0.3 ms if performing other tasks in-between starting
    # the task and requesting its result.
    #
    # The following call adds 0.5 ms to total processing time vs running the
    # code in-line:
    #   ParallelMinion::Minion.new(description: 'Count', timeout: 5) { 1 }.result
    #
    # NOTE:
    #   On JRuby it is very important to add the following setting to .jrubyrc
    #       thread.pool.enabled=true
    #
    # Example:
    #   ParallelMinion::Minion.new(10.days.ago, description: 'Doing something else in parallel', timeout: 1000) do |date|
    #     MyTable.where('created_at <= ?', date).count
